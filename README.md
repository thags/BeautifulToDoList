A follow along tutorial that helped me to learn the basics of MVC and VS Code. 


Things learned:

- vs code
- coding on mac
- A little bit of Jquery and Ajax

I switched over to a macbook and am switching to VS code, which means I needed to take a step back and get comfortable with coding in the new environment.
I was also taking some time to set up the coding environment on mac. So I had to install C# sdk, vscode and also for future sql projects I installed docker with a SQLEDGE server container.

So for this MVC project I switched from doing it completely on my own to doing a follow along tutorial.
